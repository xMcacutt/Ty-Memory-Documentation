## Ty-Objective-Documentation

This document is different. It will serve as a diary of my journey through understanding objectives in Ty in the context of Mul-Ty-Player

The objectives we'd like to sync for MTP are:

Ship Rex - Seahorses
Walk in the Park - CaveBats
Bridge on the River Ty - Dennis & Heaters
Snow Worries - Koala Kids
Lyre - Levers
Stump - Koala Kids
Rex Marks - Treasure Chests
Final Battle - Turrets (maybe)

In total this will require 7 separate class definitions with 6 unique mechanics.
Aurora and Koala Kids are so similar that the code can likely be reused.

Each objective has some standard fields.
Name
Objective Count - The amount of things. For example 8 koalas, 8 seahoses, 5 treasure chests, 5 levers. This may or may not be helpful
Objective Header Address

The best way to get started is to just throw myself into it so I'll initially study the seahorses in Ship Rex.
